This app uses the Leap Motion AR Device to teach users the American sign language alphabet. 

  Using the Leap API, the app tracks the hand position of the user and checks them with the "correct" position for specific letters (hard-coded). Users go through the alphabet as the software first shows them a picture of the correct position, then checks their hands and tells them whether they are correct or not. At the end, they can take a test and see if they can get all the alphabet hand gestures correct!
